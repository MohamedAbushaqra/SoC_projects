Brief explination on how to use this recipe:

This recipe can enable wifi dognles through usb ports. USB port is directly on the PS side of the SoC.

bsp.cfg: this is a config file for the kernel configs that we need to enable in order to configure the wifi usb dongle (drivers, etc), i enabled some extra kernel configs
since i want to use wireguard for tunneling.
Found under: PathToPetaLinuxProject/project-spec/meta-user/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-xlnx/bsp.cfg

rootfs_config: i added the rootfs packages list, this defines which packages will be compiled and packaed, we need some networking tools as well as wpa supplicant, 
in order to setup the usb wifi dongle.
Found under: PathToPetaLinuxProject/project-spec/configs/rootfs_config

system-user.dtsi: this is a device tree include file, the modification needed here is to tell the system that the wlan0 interface will be handeld by the usb0,
therefore we will create an alias that is wlan0 that is refrenced to the usb0.

The wifi-autoconnect-ps is just a recipe that can be added to the project, check the Axi_Pwm_Controller in order to know more on how to use it.

Now on the target system:

1- Modify the /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf and add the ssid, psk and the key_mgmt.

Example of the /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf :
-------------------------------------------
ctrl_interface=/var/run/wpa_supplicant
ctrl_interface_group=0
update_config=1

network={
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
        ssid="ssid"
        psk="psk"
}
-------------------------------------------

2- Now save the config file and restart the system.
3- Your system should now connect directly to the specified wifi and assign an ip4 address after each boot.
